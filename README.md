# Javascript
## My goal here is to just learn a little html, css, javascript and how web programming works in general. This is not my main interest or skill set. If you are thinking "wow, I'm extremely unimpressed by this", you are right =)

**CrypticGame:** Simple game to practice some very basic core concepts. User solves a hidden message, by solving a series of cryptic questions. Loading JSON files, updating the webpage, actions on button clicks ect.
